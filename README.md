Design Patterns

This repository explains a design pattern along with an example in Java.

1. Creational Design Patterns

  (i) Builder Pattern: Builder pattern encapsulates or hides the process of building a complex object and separates the representation of the object and its construction. The separation allows us to construct different representations using the same construction process.
    
  (ii) Prototype Pattern: Prototype design pattern is used to describe the creation of objects using prototypical instances and create new objects by copying this prototype.
